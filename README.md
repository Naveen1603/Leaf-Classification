# Leaf-Classification
<p>The image classification is a classical problem of image processing, computer vision and machine learning fields. In this model we study the image classification using deep learning. We use keras architecture with convolutional neural networks for this purpose. This deep neural network based on CNN is used to extract image features. A CNN works by extracting features from images. This eliminates the need for manual feature extraction. The features are not trained! Theyâ€™re learned while the network trains on a set of images. This makes our deep learning model extremely accurate for computer vision tasks. CNNs learn feature detection through tens or hundreds of hidden layers. Each layer increases the complexity of the learned features. </p>


<p>We will be using a leaf classification dataset which contains 1600 images of leaf specimens (16 samples each of 100 species) which have been converted to binary black leaves against white backgrounds. We will be training our model to classify the image based on the structure of the leaves.</p>
